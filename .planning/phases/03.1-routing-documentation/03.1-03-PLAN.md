  <action>
**Part A: Create Japanese routing.md**

Create `docs-site/content/ja/docs/routing.md` by translating English routing.md.

Translation rules:
- Title: "ルーティング" (Routing)
- Frontmatter: Keep weight: 4
- Translate all prose/descriptions to Japanese
- Keep ALL code blocks in English (YAML, bash, Go)
- Keep technical terms in English: round-robin, failover, shuffle, weighted-round-robin, timeout
- Translate table headers and descriptions
- Update cross-reference links to use /ja/docs/ prefix

Key Japanese translations:
- "Overview" → "概要"
- "Configuration" → "設定"
- "Strategies" → "戦略"
- "Debug Headers" → "デバッグヘッダー"
- "Failover Triggers" → "フェイルオーバートリガー"
- "Examples" → "例"
- "Next Steps" → "次のステップ"
- "default" → "デフォルト"
- "Use Case" → "ユースケース"
- "Description" → "説明"

Example translation pattern:
- EN: "Round-Robin distributes requests evenly across providers"
- JA: "Round-Robinはリクエストをプロバイダー間で均等に分配します"

**Part B: Update Japanese configuration.md**

Add Japanese routing section to `docs-site/content/ja/docs/configuration.md`.

Insert after Cache section, before Examples section.

Translate the routing section from English configuration.md:
- Section header: "## ルーティング設定"
- Table headers translated
- Descriptions translated
- Code blocks remain English
- Link to /ja/docs/routing/

Run: `hugo --source docs-site 2>&1 | grep -i error || echo "Hugo build OK"`
Check: Japanese routing.md exists with weight: 4
Check: Japanese configuration.md contains routing section
  </verify>
  <done>
Japanese routing.md and configuration.md routing section complete with proper translations
  </done>

**Part A: Create Chinese (Simplified) routing.md**

Create `docs-site/content/zh-cn/docs/routing.md` by translating English routing.md.

Translation rules:
- Title: "路由" (Routing)
- Frontmatter: Keep weight: 4
- Translate all prose/descriptions to Simplified Chinese
- Keep ALL code blocks in English (YAML, bash, Go)
- Keep technical terms in English: round-robin, failover, shuffle, weighted-round-robin, timeout

Key Chinese translations:
- "Overview" → "概述"
- "Configuration" → "配置"
- "Strategies" → "策略"
- "Debug Headers" → "调试头"
- "Failover Triggers" → "故障转移触发器"
- "Examples" → "示例"
- "Next Steps" → "后续步骤"
- "default" → "默认"
- "Use Case" → "用例"
- "Description" → "描述"

**Part B: Update Chinese configuration.md**

Add Chinese routing section to `docs-site/content/zh-cn/docs/configuration.md`.

Insert after Cache section, before Examples section.
- Section header: "## 路由配置"
- Link to /zh-cn/docs/routing/

**Part C: Create Korean routing.md**

Create `docs-site/content/ko/docs/routing.md` by translating English routing.md.

Translation rules:
- Title: "라우팅" (Routing)
- Frontmatter: Keep weight: 4
- Translate all prose/descriptions to Korean
- Keep ALL code blocks in English (YAML, bash, Go)
- Keep technical terms in English: round-robin, failover, shuffle, weighted-round-robin, timeout
- Update cross-reference links to use /ko/docs/ prefix

Key Korean translations:
- "Overview" → "개요"
- "Configuration" → "구성"
- "Strategies" → "전략"
- "Debug Headers" → "디버그 헤더"
- "Failover Triggers" → "장애 조치 트리거"
- "Examples" → "예제"
- "Next Steps" → "다음 단계"
- "default" → "기본값"
- "Use Case" → "사용 사례"
- "Description" → "설명"

**Part D: Update Korean configuration.md**

Add Korean routing section to `docs-site/content/ko/docs/configuration.md`.

Insert after Cache section, before Examples section.
- Section header: "## 라우팅 구성"
- Link to /ko/docs/routing/
