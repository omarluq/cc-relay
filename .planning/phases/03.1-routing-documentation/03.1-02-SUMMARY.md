# Phase 03.1 Plan 02: German and Spanish Routing Documentation Summary

German/Spanish routing docs with full translations, technical terms preserved, code blocks in English.

## Tasks Completed

| Task | Description | Commit | Files |
|------|-------------|--------|-------|
| 1 | German routing documentation | ae09468 | routing.md, configuration.md |
| 2 | Spanish routing documentation | d0853de | routing.md, configuration.md |

## Implementation Details

### German Documentation (de/)

Created `docs-site/content/de/docs/routing.md` with:
- Full German prose translation
- Technical terms preserved (round-robin, failover, shuffle, weighted-round-robin)
- All code blocks in English/YAML
- Cross-references to `/de/docs/` prefix

Updated `docs-site/content/de/docs/configuration.md`:
- Added Routing-Konfiguration section in complete config reference YAML block
- Added standalone Routing section with strategies table
- Updated "Naechste Schritte" links to include routing

Key German translations used:
- "Overview" -> "Ueberblick"
- "Configuration" -> "Konfiguration"
- "Strategies" -> "Strategien"
- "Debug Headers" -> "Debug-Header"
- "Failover Triggers" -> "Failover-Ausloeser"
- "Next Steps" -> "Naechste Schritte"

### Spanish Documentation (es/)

Created `docs-site/content/es/docs/routing.md` with:
- Full Spanish prose translation
- Technical terms preserved (round-robin, failover, shuffle, weighted-round-robin)
- All code blocks in English/YAML
- Cross-references to `/es/docs/` prefix

Updated `docs-site/content/es/docs/configuration.md`:
- Added Configuracion de Routing section in complete config reference YAML block
- Added standalone Routing section with strategies table
- Updated "Siguientes Pasos" links to include routing

Key Spanish translations used:
- "Overview" -> "Descripcion General"
- "Configuration" -> "Configuracion"
- "Strategies" -> "Estrategias"
- "Debug Headers" -> "Cabeceras de Depuracion"
- "Failover Triggers" -> "Disparadores de Failover"
- "Next Steps" -> "Proximos Pasos"

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| German section header | "Routing-Konfiguration" | German compound word pattern consistent with other config sections |
| Spanish section header | "Configuracion de Routing" | Spanish preposition pattern matching existing cache documentation |
| Technical term preservation | Keep English | Standard industry terminology, avoiding confusion |
| Code block language | English/YAML | Configuration values must match actual usage |

## Verification Results

- [x] German routing.md created with weight: 4
- [x] Spanish routing.md created with weight: 4
- [x] German configuration.md has routing section
- [x] Spanish configuration.md has routing section
- [x] All code blocks remain in English
- [x] Hugo builds without errors

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Next Phase Readiness

**Dependencies satisfied:**
- 03.1-01 English routing docs exist (source for translation)

**This plan provides:**
- German routing documentation for German-speaking users
- Spanish routing documentation for Spanish-speaking users
- Consistent translation patterns for future i18n work

**Remaining in phase:**
- 03.1-03: Japanese and Chinese routing documentation (Wave 2, parallel with this plan)
