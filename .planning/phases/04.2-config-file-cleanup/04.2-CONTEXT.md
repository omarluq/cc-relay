# Phase 4.2: Config File Cleanup - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-23
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Consolidate duplicate config files by removing `config.yaml` from root, keeping `example.yaml` as the canonical reference. This is a gap closure phase addressing duplicate config files identified in the v0.0.1 milestone audit.

## Implementation Decisions

### Claude's Discretion

User indicated this is straightforward cleanup — Claude has full discretion on:
- How to handle code references to config.yaml
- Documentation updates needed
- CLI help text adjustments
- Any deprecation handling

### Implementation Approach

The roadmap already specifies:
1. Remove config.yaml from root
2. Keep example.yaml as canonical reference
3. Update code/doc references appropriately
4. Ensure `cc-relay config init` still works correctly
