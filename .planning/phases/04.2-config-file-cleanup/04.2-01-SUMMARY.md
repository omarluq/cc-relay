# Phase 4.2 Plan 01: Config File Cleanup Summary

**Removed duplicate config.yaml and consolidated documentation to reference example.yaml as canonical config**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 2 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-23T20:42:30Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-23T20:44:50Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 5 (4 modified, 1 deleted)

## Accomplishments

- Deleted config.yaml from repository root (was duplicate of example.yaml)
- Updated all documentation to reference example.yaml instead of config/example.yaml
- Verified cc-relay config init still generates valid config from embedded template

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Delete config.yaml and update documentation references** - `db20cdb` (chore)
2. **Task 2: Verify cc-relay config init still works** - No commit (verification-only task)

## Files Created/Modified

- `config.yaml` (DELETED) - Removed duplicate config file
- `.claude/CLAUDE.md` - Updated config reference and example command
- `llms.txt` - Updated file structure and documentation link
- `.claude/skills/auto-fix-code.md` - Updated yamlfmt example
- `.claude/skills/fix-format-issues.md` - Updated yamlfmt example

## Decisions Made

- **example.yaml as canonical:** example.yaml is the canonical config reference included in releases; config.yaml was an unnecessary development artifact
- **Historical accuracy:** Planning files in .planning/phases/ retain their original config/example.yaml references to preserve historical accuracy
- **Scope exclusions:** Cache files (.claude/cache/) and worktrees (worktrees/) are transient/separate and not part of cleanup scope

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

- **config init flag mismatch:** Plan specified `--config` flag but actual implementation uses `--output` for specifying output path. Used correct `--output` flag with `--force` to run verification.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Phase 4.2 complete - config cleanup done
- Ready for Phase 4.3 (Documentation Gaps) to address any remaining documentation inconsistencies
- Repository now has clean, consolidated config reference
