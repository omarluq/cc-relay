# Phase 01.3 Plan 01: English Site Caching Documentation Summary

**English site caching.md updated with HA Clustering Guide including port requirements, environment settings, cluster examples, and troubleshooting for nodes/quorum/replication issues**

## Performance

- Added environment settings table (local/lan/wan timings)
- Added two-node and three-node cluster examples with YAML configs
- Added replication and quorum explanation with recommendation tables
- Added HA-specific troubleshooting sections

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:
