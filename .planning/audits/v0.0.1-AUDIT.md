# Release Audit: cc-relay v0.0.1

**Release Date:** 2026-01-15
**Tag:** v0.0.1
**Status:** PREMATURE RELEASE - MVP Incomplete

## Executive Summary

Version 0.0.1 was released prematurely as a "working MVP" but only delivered **22% of planned features**. The release contained false advertising in the README claiming multi-provider support that wasn't implemented.

**Grade:** D (Premature, incomplete)

## Feature Completion

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| HTTP Proxy Server | ✅ Partial | Basic structure only |
| Anthropic Provider | ✅ Complete | Direct passthrough |
| Configuration | ⚠️ Stub | Hardcoded values |
| Multiple Providers | ❌ Missing | README claimed support |
| Rate Limiting | ❌ Missing | Not implemented |
| Health Tracking | ❌ Missing | Not implemented |
| Routing Strategies | ❌ Missing | Not implemented |
| SSE Streaming | ⚠️ Basic | Passthrough only |

**Completion:** 2/9 core features (22%)

## Gaps Identified

### Critical Gaps

1. **False README Claims**
   - README stated "multi-provider support"
   - Only Anthropic passthrough was implemented
   - **Impact:** User trust, misrepresentation

2. **No Configuration System**
   - Hardcoded provider URLs
   - No YAML/TOML support
   - **Impact:** Unusable for any real deployment

3. **No Rate Limiting**
   - Claimed feature not present
   - **Impact:** Would exhaust API keys immediately

4. **No Health Tracking**
   - No circuit breaker
   - No failure detection
   - **Impact:** No reliability guarantees

### Code Quality Issues

| Issue | Severity | Location |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Hardcoded URLs | HIGH | proxy/handler.go |
| No error handling | HIGH | Multiple files |
| No tests | HIGH | 0% coverage |
| No logging | MEDIUM | All files |

## Phase 1 Status at v0.0.1

| Requirement | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| POST /v1/messages | ✅ |
| Anthropic headers | ✅ |
| SSE streaming | ⚠️ Partial |
| Error responses | ❌ |
| tool_use_id preservation | ❌ |
| Configuration loading | ❌ |

**Phase 1 Completion:** 2/7 (28%)

## Action Items

### Immediate (v0.0.2)

1. **Fix README** - Remove false claims
2. **Add Configuration** - Basic YAML loading
3. **Add Error Handling** - Proper HTTP error responses
4. **Add Logging** - Structured logging

### Short-term (v0.0.3)

5. **Add Tests** - Target 60% coverage
6. **Multiple Providers** - Actually implement what README claimed
7. **Rate Limiting** - Basic implementation

## Lessons Learned

1. **Don't release with false documentation**
2. **Don't tag versions without tests**
3. **MVP should mean "minimum viable" not "nothing works"**

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Tests pass: N/A (no tests)
- [ ] README accurate: ❌ FALSE CLAIMS
- [ ] Docs match code: ❌
- [ ] CI passing: ❌ (no CI)
